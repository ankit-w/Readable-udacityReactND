# Readable API Server

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where I've built the 'Readable' app.


## How to run:

To get started :

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, use:
    - `cd readable-client`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
